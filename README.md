# Linux_file_management
Managing files with linux commands
This repository demonstrates how to manage and manipulate files using various Linux commands. The files in this project simulate real-world scenarios involving file operations such as creating, modifying, removing, and analyzing files. The commands included in this repository will help understand how to work with file systems, process files, and analyze their contents in a Linux environment.
Files Included

    file1.txt: A file containing system logs and configuration data.
    file2.txt: A file containing temporary configuration notes, including IP addresses and ports.
    file3.txt: A file containing sensitive user data, including user IDs and email addresses.

Key Operations

This repository covers essential Linux commands to manage files, such as:

    File Creation and Modification:
        touch, nano, vim, gedit
        Example: Creating a new file and adding data to it.

    Navigating Directories:
        cd, ls, pwd
        Example: Moving between directories to manage files.

    File Operations:
        cp, mv, rm, mv, cat
        Example: Copying, moving, or removing files.

    Text Processing:
        grep, awk, cut, sed, wc
        Example: Searching for specific text, extracting data, or counting occurrences.

    File Metadata:
        stat
        Example: Checking timestamps and other metadata for a file.

Questions and Commands

The repository also includes 20 questions based on the contents of the files. These questions help to analyze and extract key information using the appropriate Linux commands. Examples of questions include:

    What is the timestamp of the last log entry in file1.txt?
    Which user is associated with the most recent log event in file1.txt?
    How many times does the word "password" appear in file3.txt?

Example Commands Used

    grep: To search for specific patterns or strings within the files.

grep -i "error" file1.txt

awk: To process and extract data from structured text.

awk '{print $2}' file2.txt

stat: To display file metadata like timestamps.

    stat file1.txt
